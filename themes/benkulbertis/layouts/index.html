	<h4 style="display: inline"><strong>Hey! I'm Ben.</strong></h4> I'm a dev/ops engineer living in Salt Lake City, Utah. I'm current working at <strong>Twitch</strong> in the Global Service Operations Center (GSOC) developing tooling for video operations and providing operational support to our video systems and networking infrastructure. At <strong>Twitch</strong> I've been able to further my knowledge of global infratructure best practices and operations demands as well as my programming prowess with Golang. Prior to <strong>Twitch</strong> I helped develop the <a href='http://slateci.io'>SLATE research platform</a>, a Kubernetes-based service layer with a multi-institutional federated edge deployment architecture. I developed <a href='https://github.com/slateci/minislate'>MiniSLATE</a>, a Docker Compose based development environment for creating Helm charts for SLATE that utilized a unique Kubernetes-in-Docker architecture. I'm very interested in the development to scalable deployment pipeline, with past experience in Puppet and CI/CD pipelines. I'm proficient in Python, Golang, Javscript/Node, and (abeit probably a bit rusty) Java and PHP. I'm also interested in cryptocurrency, the gaming industry in general, and many types of music. If any of my interests interest you, drop me a line at <a href="mailto:ben@kulbertis.org">ben@kulbertis.org</a>. See you around!
