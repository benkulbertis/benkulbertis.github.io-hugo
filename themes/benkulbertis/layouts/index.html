	<h4 style="display: inline"><strong class="twitch">Hey! I'm Ben.</strong></h4> I automate video operations at <a href="https://ivs.rocks/"><strong class="aws">Amazon IVS</strong></a>/<a href="https://www.twitch.tv"><strong class="twitch">Twitch</strong></a> in Irvine, CA. A Linux terminal junkie at heart, I write software in Go and Python that lets our operators spend less time looking up terminal commands and more time fixing problems. Utilizing AWS services such as Lambda and Step Functions our automation responds to anomalies in our infrastructure across our diverse server fleet. We leverage IoC technologies like Terraform and CDK to rapidly develop and deploy infrastructure in AWS regions around the world. Prior to <strong class="twitch">Twitch</strong> I helped develop the <a href='http://slateci.io'><strong class="slate">SLATE research platform</strong></a>, a Kubernetes-based service layer with a multi-institutional federated edge deployment architecture. I developed <a href='https://github.com/slateci/minislate'><strong class="slate">MiniSLATE</strong></a>, a Docker Compose based development environment for creating Helm charts for <strong class="slate">SLATE</strong> that utilized a unique Kubernetes-in-Docker architecture. Outside of software dev I'm also interested in the gaming industry, economics/finance, and many types of music.
