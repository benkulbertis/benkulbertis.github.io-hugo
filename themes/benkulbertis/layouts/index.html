	<h4 style="display: inline"><strong class="twitch">Hey! I'm Ben.</strong></h4> I'm a dev/ops engineer living in Salt Lake City, Utah. I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv"><strong class="twitch">Twitch</strong></a> developing and maintaining tooling and infrastructure for video operations. At <strong class="twitch">Twitch</strong> I've been able to further my knowledge of global infrastructure best practices and operations demands associated with that. I also have the opportunity to regularly improve my development skills, lately with emphasis on infrastructure as code. Prior to <strong class="twitch">Twitch</strong> I helped develop the <a href='http://slateci.io'><strong class="slate">SLATE research platform</strong></a>, a Kubernetes-based service layer with a multi-institutional federated edge deployment architecture. I developed <a href='https://github.com/slateci/minislate'><strong class="slate">MiniSLATE</strong></a>, a Docker Compose based development environment for creating Helm charts for <strong class="slate">SLATE</strong> that utilized a unique Kubernetes-in-Docker architecture. I'm very interested in the development to scalable deployment pipeline, with past experience in Puppet and CI/CD pipelines. Currently I am utilizing Terraform quite a bit to orchestrate and codify AWS infrastructure, especially with Elastic Container Service (ECS). I love the command line and quick and useful scripts. I'm proficient in Python, Golang, Javscript/Node, and (abeit probably a bit rusty) Java and PHP, whatever the project demands. I'm also interested in cryptocurrency, the gaming industry in general, and many types of music. If any of my interests interest you, drop me a line at <a href="mailto:ben@kulbertis.org">ben@kulbertis.org</a>. See you around!
