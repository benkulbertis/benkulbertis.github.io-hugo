	<h4 style="display: inline"><strong>Hey! I'm Ben.</strong></h4> I'm a dev/ops engineer living in Salt Lake City, Utah. My current interests include deployment and architecture utilizing containers, especially with <strong>Kubernetes</strong>. I'm currently helping develop the <a href='http://slateci.io'>SLATE research platform</a>, a Kubernetes-based service layer with a multi-institutional federated edge deployment architecture. I developed <a href='https://github.com/slateci/minislate'>MiniSLATE</a> a <strong>Docker Compose</strong> based development environment for creating <strong>Helm</strong> charts for SLATE. Turns out Docker-in-Docker works pretty well as Kubernetes-in-Docker so we've been able to realize the <a href='https://medium.com/travis-on-docker/why-and-how-to-use-docker-for-development-a156c1de3b24'>advantages of a containerized development environment</a>. Prior to my work on SLATE I worked on web deployment and provided platform administration to web services at the University of Utah. I took an aging architecture to a more modern and scalable state thanks to an architecture redesign and <strong>Puppet</strong>, allowing orchestrating of website provisioning and migrations. While I've been behind a terminal almost every day for the last 10 years I'm glad I spend a lot less time provisioning servers that way. We also saw great improvements running a cluster for MySQL databases and caching/load balancing requests. We saw more than a 50% drop in required resources to serve our users. I really enjoy writing code as well in my free time (perhaps one reason I love Infrastructure as Code). Most days you'll catch me writing <strong>Python</strong> (or Bash ;), but I've written/contributed to projects in Javascript/NodeJS, Ruby (with Rails), Java, and PHP. I'm also interested in cryptocurrency, the gaming industry, and indie music. If any of my interests interest you, drop me a line at <a href="mailto:ben@kulbertis.org">ben@kulbertis.org</a>. See you around!
